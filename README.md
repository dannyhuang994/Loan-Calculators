In this project, I have implemented two calculators:

1. **Loan Repayment Calculator**: This calculator helps users estimate their monthly loan repayments based on factors such as loan amount, interest rate, and loan term.

2. **Refinance Calculator**: The refinance calculator assists users in determining potential savings from refinancing their loan. It considers factors such as the original loan details, new interest rate, new loan term, and refinance fees. (Present value of loan or the remaining principal is computed along with new monthly payment and total savings)

You can access the [Loan Repayment Calculator](https://dannyhuang994.github.io/Loan-Repayment-Calculators/loan-payment-calculator) and the [Refinance Calculator](https://dannyhuang994.github.io/Loan-Repayment-Calculators/refinance-calculator).
